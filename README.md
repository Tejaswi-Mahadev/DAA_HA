# DESIGN ANALYSIS AND ALGORITHMS -  HOLIDAY ASSIGNMENT

## CASE-STUDY 
###Scenario
An e-commerce platform is implementing a feature where products need to be sorted by various attributes (e.g., price, rating, and name). The product list contains millions of items, and the sorting operation needs to be efficient and scalable.

1. What are the time and space complexities of the commonly used sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort)?

3. How do the characteristics of the data (e.g., range of prices, product name lengths) impact the choice of sorting algorithm?
